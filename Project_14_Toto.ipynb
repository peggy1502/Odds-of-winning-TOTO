    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to help TOTO lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project will build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "- *What is the probability of winning the Jackpot prize with a single ticket?*\n",
    "- *What is the probability of winning the Jackpot prize if we play 50 different tickets (or any other number)?*\n",
    "- *What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket?*\n",

    "The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to practice applying the concepts learned in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario. Throughout the project, we'll need to calculate repeatedly probabilities and combinations.\n"

    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build the core functions required to be used in our programs to calculate factorial and combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before that, let's recap on the following concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permutation\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation is referring to certain arrangement where the order of the individual elements are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 3-digit PIN code have 10x10x10=1000 permutations. This means we can have, let's say PIN code `377`, which is not the same as `773` or `737`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do sampling without replacement (i.e. no repetition of elements), the number of permutations or different arrangements that we can get from a set of 5 items are 5x4x3x2x1=120. This is represented as `5!` (meaning 5 factorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we were asked to choose 2 out of 5 items, then we will have 5x4=20 permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented as <sub>n</sub>P<sub>k</sub> in the formula below, where in this case: n=5, k=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Permutation](Permutation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "Combination is referring to arrangements where the order doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented as <sub>n</sub>C<sub>k</sub> in the formula below, which we’re reading as “n choose k”.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Combination](Combination.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, “5 choose 2”, or <sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> will have 10 combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the example of rolling a die, where the set of all possible outcomes, or the sample space of a die roll, Ω = {1,2,3,4,5,6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, let's consider the event E as \"*getting an even number when rolling a die*\". Thus an outcome for event E is considered as *successful outcome* if it is 2, 4, or 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of event E, denoted by *P(E)*, is\n",

    "In the TOTO lottery, six Winning Numbers and one Additional Number are drawn from 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A player wins the Jackpot prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six Winning Numbers drawn. If a player has a ticket with the numbers {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}, he only wins the Jackpot prize if the Winning Numbers drawn are {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}.\n",
